# Funky Code-Challenge

## Backend
Adjust the function `autoCompleteAddress` inside the `src/server.ts` file so it will return an array of Address objects.
The goal is to return a list of unique addresses that the user can choose from.

**Rules:**
* All existing test pass
* You send a valid query to the BASE_URL and use it's response
* No TypeScript errors or warning in the code
* No other dependecies should be installed

**Bonus:** Only start this task when you are 100% sure the rest is absolutely perfect! Implement an addional function called `autoCompleteAddressWithoutNo` which returns the same but without the house numbers. Don't change the existing interfaces.
